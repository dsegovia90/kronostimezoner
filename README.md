# Kronos Timezoner

Scheduling and sharing times for meetings and other needs can be difficult when communicating across timezones.

Kronos Timezoner is a Slack app that simplifies the translation of time between members of the same team who reside or are located in different timezones.

Kronos Timezoner is a Build-to-Learn project started by members of the Chingu-Voyage-Bears-Team-1 cohort. Please be patient as we continue to work out bugs, make improvements, and add new features.

And (of course!) feel free to join in the fun!

## Getting Started

### Using the app and website

Getting started with the website is as simple as navigating to the app (http://www.kronostimzoner.com)/

Install the Kronos Timezoner app to your slack team using the install button to access its features. After installation, the app will automatically translate your first time input into the timezone for each team member in the group or to each member to whom you send a direct message.

- HH:MM
- H:MM (will translate to AM)
- H:MMam (or pm)
- H:MM am  (or pm)
